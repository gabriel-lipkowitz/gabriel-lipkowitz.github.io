<p class='fw-light'>My name is Gabriel Lipkowitz. I am an incoming assistant professor at the National University of Singapore in the Division of Industrial Design (to begin Nov. 2024), having recently graduated from Stanford University. I'm passionate about leveraging new technologies to push the boundaries of interactive 3D design in applications ranging from spatial computing to 3D visualization to new media art. You can read more about my work below.</p>

<p class='fw-light'>In my free time, I love cycling 🚴, visiting art museums 🏛️, and seeking out good coffee ☕️. More than happy to chat about anything related to research or outside of research!</p>
